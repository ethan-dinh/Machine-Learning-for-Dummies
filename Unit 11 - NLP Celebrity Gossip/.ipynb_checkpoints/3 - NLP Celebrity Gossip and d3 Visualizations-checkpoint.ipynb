It's one of those situations where you had the right way, but you lost the right of way.\"His advice to Venus ... let the insurance companies sort it all out.The bodycam footage also includes the Barsons sitting in their Hyundai, waiting for treatment.

The officer on scene has clearly spoken to witnesses and is now sharing information about the accident with fellow officers ... and says \"I will find her at fault\" ... referring to Venus.And then he walks up to Venus' SUV -- she's still sitting in the driver's seat -- and explains that from the time she entered the intersection and stopped -- for opposing traffic -- the light changed, \"and he had a green light, so you kind of violated his right of way.\"For some reason ... shortly thereafter the officer says, \"I don't feel comfortable citing [Venus] for it.\"Full disclosure -- the bodycam footage appears to be edited in places. The source that provided the video says that was done to avoid showing any injuries to people involved in the accident.Ultimately, the officer's take on what happened won't determine who was at fault in the wrongful death lawsuit filed by Jerome Barson's estate. A jury would also consider the surveillance video, black box data from both vehicles and other factors.As we first reported ... the Barsons' attorney says data from Venus' SUV shows she accelerated from nearly zero to 19.9 MPH in 4.2 seconds as she attempted to clear the intersection.Venus was in Washington, D.C.

You could say they were on Kyrie's turf ... playing pop-a-shot at Dave & Buster's.We're told Kyrie and Carl have been close for years, but Justin and the NBA star are more like acquaintances.NBA fans have been baffled as to why Kyrie would want to leave a team that's been to the NBA Finals 3 years straight.

He says it shows she was traveling at 19.9 MPH when Jerome and his wife T-boned her.He also says the numbers show Venus got up to that speed in 4.2 seconds. His take on the data -- Venus probably \"looked up, saw the red light and gunned it.\"Remember, the surveillance video shows Venus start into the intersection, but stop to allow another vehicle to turn left in front of her. Up to now, we only knew Venus told cops she was doing about 5 MPH as she started into the intersection. The police report also put the Barson's Hyundai at 25 MPH.If, as Steinger says, Venus was doing 20 MPH after the light had changed, the obvious question becomes -- was she reckless in her attempt to clear the intersection?\n",

We're told publishers fear a major backlash, or boycott, that could impact their roster of authors.Another reason he's considered toxic is publishers don't see people rushing to put money in O.J.'s pocket, because the public still considers him guilty of double murder.

Kelly is guilty of pampering women with so much luxury they become dependent on him and don't want to leave, even though they can ... according to family members of one of the women.Our sources, related to the woman -- who was 20 when she moved in with Kelly last year -- say she met him backstage during a concert meet and greet. She communicated with the singer for about 6 months before he asked her to live with him ... and she agreed.However, we're told the woman -- who is not an aspiring singer like Joycelyn Savage -- has been free to leave Kelly's pads in Illinois and Georgia ... and has done so on multiple occasions. We're told she's flown out-of-state, unaccompanied to visit family.She's never stayed longer than a week and always returned to Kelly, who she describes as \"her man.\"So, why does she stay? Our sources say the woman has been flown to Beverly Hills for shopping sprees, and Kelly also buys high-priced handbags, lingerie, shoes and spa trips for all of the girlfriends. We're told Kelly openly says he \"wants to shower them in luxury.\"Not that they think Kelly is totally innocent. One family member believes Kelly has a \"calculating, methodical process to groom naive girls\" -- and confirmed he takes their smartphones.The woman has never mentioned any physical abuse ... nor has her family seen evidence of it. While they don't see anything criminal about Kelly's tactics, they feel he uses psychological abuse to make the girls fully reliant on him.\n",

'cause she's got a new hip-hop king to occupy her mind.Sources close to Nicki tell TMZ she hasn't batted an eyelash over news Meek Mill might have ordered his goons to jump her other ex, Safaree. And the reason is simple ... Nas.We're told Nicki doesn't feel anything about the fight, mostly 'cause it's not her problem ... and both of those dudes are in her rearview. More importantly ... she's happily moving on with her new man, Mr. Jones ... although it's still in the early stages.Only KINGS recognize QUEENS. @sweetchicklife has the best food 👅 congrats @nas 😜A post shared by Nicki Minaj (@nickiminaj) on May 9, 2017 at 10:53pm PDTAs we reported ... Safaree challenged Meek to a 1-on-1 fight after he claimed Meek orchestrated the attack on him. Meek denies that.Either way, the bottom line here ... Nicki's over both Meek and Safaree, and their beef is theirs alone.Somewhere, she and Nas are playing the Counting Crows -- looking deep into each other's eyes.\n",

We're told they have no intention of living there past August because Blue Ivy is enrolled in an exclusive school in the heart of L.A. and the drive is way too far.Before moving to the Malibu mansion, Bey, Jay and Blue Ivy were living in a luxurious hotel as they hunted in vain for a place of their own.Our real estate sources say the Carters have been frustrated because their search -- which has gone on for several years -- has hit a stumbling block, and the stumbling block is cash.We're told their budget is around $75 million, give or take a few mil. It sounds nuts, but they can't find a place they love for the amount they're willing to spend. As one well-connected source puts it, \"They want a super baller, crazy estate, and the ones they love are going for $150 mil.\"Our sources say the Carters have seen just about everything that's on the market and nothing in their price range is floating their boat.Yes, it's just nuts.\n",

Also, Chris never sat in the audience -- he was only backstage, and he and Karrueche never crossed paths.We're told BET invited her almost 2 months ago to present an award, and she agreed so she could promote her show, \"Claws.\" Remember, she was smack in the middle of her case against Chris at that time ... which included allegations he'd made violent threats.It seemed odd she chose to be at the same event as him, but it's now clear BET went out of its way to address any concerns Karrueche might have -- and to ensure Chris didn't violate the protective order.Of course, none of that prevented her new bf Quavo, and his Migos crew, from squaring off with Chris at an after-party.\n",
