It's one of those situations where you had the right way, but you lost the right of way.\"His advice to Venus ... let the insurance companies sort it all out.The bodycam footage also includes the Barsons sitting in their Hyundai, waiting for treatment.

The officer on scene has clearly spoken to witnesses and is now sharing information about the accident with fellow officers ... and says \"I will find her at fault\" ... referring to Venus.And then he walks up to Venus' SUV -- she's still sitting in the driver's seat -- and explains that from the time she entered the intersection and stopped -- for opposing traffic -- the light changed, \"and he had a green light, so you kind of violated his right of way.\"For some reason ... shortly thereafter the officer says, \"I don't feel comfortable citing [Venus] for it.\"Full disclosure -- the bodycam footage appears to be edited in places. The source that provided the video says that was done to avoid showing any injuries to people involved in the accident.Ultimately, the officer's take on what happened won't determine who was at fault in the wrongful death lawsuit filed by Jerome Barson's estate. A jury would also consider the surveillance video, black box data from both vehicles and other factors.As we first reported ... the Barsons' attorney says data from Venus' SUV shows she accelerated from nearly zero to 19.9 MPH in 4.2 seconds as she attempted to clear the intersection.Venus was in Washington, D.C.

His take on the data -- Venus probably \"looked up, saw the red light and gunned it.\"Remember, the surveillance video shows Venus start into the intersection, but stop to allow another vehicle to turn left in front of her. Up to now, we only knew Venus told cops she was doing about 5 MPH as she started into the intersection. The police report also put the Barson's Hyundai at 25 MPH.If, as Steinger says, Venus was doing 20 MPH after the light had changed, the obvious question becomes -- was she reckless in her attempt to clear the intersection?\n",

We're told publishers fear a major backlash, or boycott, that could impact their roster of authors.Another reason he's considered toxic is publishers don't see people rushing to put money in O.J.'s pocket, because the public still considers him guilty of double murder.

We're told she's flown out-of-state, unaccompanied to visit family.She's never stayed longer than a week and always returned to Kelly, who she describes as \"her man.\"So, why does she stay? Our sources say the woman has been flown to Beverly Hills for shopping sprees, and Kelly also buys high-priced handbags, lingerie, shoes and spa trips for all of the girlfriends. We're told Kelly openly says he \"wants to shower them in luxury.\"Not that they think Kelly is totally innocent. One family member believes Kelly has a \"calculating, methodical process to groom naive girls\" -- and confirmed he takes their smartphones.The woman has never mentioned any physical abuse ... nor has her family seen evidence of it. While they don't see anything criminal about Kelly's tactics, they feel he uses psychological abuse to make the girls fully reliant on him.\n",

And the reason is simple ... Nas.We're told Nicki doesn't feel anything about the fight, mostly 'cause it's not her problem ... and both of those dudes are in her rearview. More importantly ... she's happily moving on with her new man, Mr. Jones ... although it's still in the early stages.Only KINGS recognize QUEENS. @sweetchicklife has the best food 👅 congrats @nas 😜A post shared by Nicki Minaj (@nickiminaj) on May 9, 2017 at 10:53pm PDTAs we reported ... Safaree challenged Meek to a 1-on-1 fight after he claimed Meek orchestrated the attack on him. Meek denies that.Either way, the bottom line here ... Nicki's over both Meek and Safaree, and their beef is theirs alone.Somewhere, she and Nas are playing the Counting Crows -- looking deep into each other's eyes.\n",

We're told they have no intention of living there past August because Blue Ivy is enrolled in an exclusive school in the heart of L.A. and the drive is way too far.Before moving to the Malibu mansion, Bey, Jay and Blue Ivy were living in a luxurious hotel as they hunted in vain for a place of their own.Our real estate sources say the Carters have been frustrated because their search -- which has gone on for several years -- has hit a stumbling block, and the stumbling block is cash.We're told their budget is around $75 million, give or take a few mil. It sounds nuts, but they can't find a place they love for the amount they're willing to spend. As one well-connected source puts it, \"They want a super baller, crazy estate, and the ones they love are going for $150 mil.\"Our sources say the Carters have seen just about everything that's on the market and nothing in their price range is floating their boat.Yes, it's just nuts.\n",

The letter, which includes photos, notes the catsuits Bleu sent were full body, long sleeve and lined with crystals distributed evenly.The one Khloe designed is a sleeveless leotard, like a corset, with crystals concentrated in the bust area.The letter shows indignation from the get-go, calls it \"a cheap publicity stunt in order to garner attention for herself and generate sales of her merchandise.\"\n",

      "Top 5 articles similar to Article #100: \"Bachelor In Paradise\" is hyping a one-on-one showdown between Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson, but it will actually be more like Michael Phelps' race against a great white shark.Sources close to production tell us Corinne and DeMario did NOT come face-to-face when the reunion show taped Saturday. While promoting the show, host Chris Harrison has said he'll be talking with both of them together ... insinuating he'd be mediating/refereeing.While fans would eat that up ... it ain't gonna happen. We're told DeMario came out for a solo sit-down with Harrison, but left before Corinne did her one-on-one. We're told neither were briefed on plans to be onstage at the same time.Our DeMario sources tell us he's no longer interested in seeing Corinne face-to-face to hash out the aftermath from their pool sex encounter -- mostly because he doesn't think she would be genuine. \n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendation #1 Turns out controversial \"Bachelor In Paradise\" star DeMario Jackson may not be done with reality TV -- TMZ has learned producers are seriously considering him for a \"Dancing With the Stars\" slot.Sources close to production tell us the show reached out to DeMario's publicist weeks ago, which explains why he was already fully campaigning to be in the ballroom when we asked about it last week.We're told nothing's signed ... they're still negotiating, but hard to imagine a scenario where DeMario doesn't take this opportunity.DeMario didn't return to the 'BiP' set in Mexico following the oral sex controversy with Corinne Olympios that shut down production, but he will be on the reunion episode.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendation #2 \"Bachelor in Paradise\" has a new way of reeling in viewers ... tapping into the sex scandal that temporarily shipwrecked the show.Production sources tell TMZ, host Chris Harrison held a powwow with the cast on the first day back to film the show after the Warner Bros. probe concluded there was no sexual assault ... and the cameras were rolling as he took people back to the Corinne Olympios/DeMario Jackson sexual escapade in the pool.We're told Harrison dramatically recounted how a producer expressed concerns and it turned into a full blown scandal. After taking everyone through the investigation, he paused, then asked the cast if they were comfortable continuing, and gave them a chance to pack up and leave.To absolutely no one's surprise, everyone stayed, drank and even banged in the boom boom room.Lemonade ... it comes from lemons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendation #3 DeMario Jackson is looking for answers, and thinks a 1-on-1 with Corinne Olympios could help him finally get some peace of mind ... but she's gotta make the first move.Sources close to the \"Bachelor in Paradise\" outcast tell TMZ ... he wants to chat with Corinne about her sexual assault claim. DeMario's telling friends he doesn't hold a grudge -- after being cleared by Warner Bros. -- especially since he's bound to see Corinne again with other 'Bachelor' alums.We're told DeMario was \"blindsided and confused\" when he heard she claimed to be a victim, because when they got sent home producers told him it was because a third party had a problem with their pool sexcapade -- not Corinne.DeMario assumed he and Corinne would move on and be friends since they got along so well the first day filming -- laughing, chatting and hooking up -- so he doesn't understand what changed.There's a catch -- we're also told DeMario's not going to reach out to Corinne. He feels the ball's in her court since she played the victim card ... but he'll drop everything to meet with her if she calls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendation #4 Corinne Olympios' boyfriend knew exactly what he was signing up for when she decided to go on \"Bachelor in Paradise\" ... with one HUGE caveat.Sources close to the couple tell TMZ ... Corinne and her BF, Jordan Gielchinsky, agreed she would NOT hook up with other cast members, and was only going to do the show to get pub for her new clothing line. Her plan was to be on for a couple episodes, and then bow out.Of course, that plan went to crap on the first day of taping when DeMario Jackson and Corinne ended up \"rubbing, touching and fingering\" in the pool. We broke the story ... Warner Bros. shut down production, launched an investigation and sent the cast home.We're told Jordan was initially upset when he heard what went down, but once he got the full context of the event -- meaning the heavy drinking -- he backed Corinne. He agrees she was way too drunk to give consent, and strongly believes producers and medical staffers should have intervened.The couple's been inseparable in L.A. since she returned from Mexico.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendation #5 Production for 'Bachelor in Paradise' has been suspended after allegations of misconduct were reported ... which puts a halt to filming for the upcoming season indefinitely.Warner Bros. execs for the show said Sunday that they had been alerted to some sort of misconduct on the set of 'BiP', which is currently shooting in Mexico.As a result of the allegations -- which at this point have not been made public -- WB has put a temporary halt to the show and is now investigating. They've said they will also take appropriate action upon completing the investigation.This season of 'BiP' is highly anticipated, especially after Nick Viall's recent stint on 'The Bachelor.' Some of his axed ladies like Raven Gates, Corinne Olympios and Taylor Nolan were cast, as was Amanda Stanton from Ben Higgins' season. Some of the guys cast were Derek Peth, Nick Benvenutti, Ben Zorn and DeMario Jackson.\n",

      "Top 5 articles similar to Article #22: Blac Chyna had the cops called on her after Rob's baby mama went ham over a roofer.It happened Tuesday morning at Chyna's L.A. home. She pitched a fit when a guy next door started pitching a roof at 9 AM. We're told Chyna confronted the homeowner, saying it was too damn early to start construction. She said the noise woke up little Dream, and that pissed her off.The neighbor claims Chyna went so ballistic she got scared and called the cops.We're told cops showed up and gave Chyna a free lesson about the law. In L.A., construction can fire up at 7 AM, so the roofer was well within his rights.Chyna calmed down, and cops beat it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendation #1 Rob Kardashian's revenge against Blac Chyna -- posting pics of her vagina and breasts -- would seem to violate the revenge porn law ... but that doesn't seem to be the case.As we reported, Rob believed Chyna was cheating on him and he went on the warpath, not only posting the pics but after they were removed ... he reposted them.In California there's a 2013 law which states ... \"A person who intentionally distributes the image of the intimate body part of another ... knowing they'll cause emotional distress\" is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by up to 6 months in jail.You would think it's a textbook case of revenge porn, but there's a rub. Chyna \"liked\" the pics on Instagram, so it's hard to argue she suffered emotional distress.What's more ... the law says in order to be convicted there must have been an understanding the images would remain private. \"Liking\" the pics does not seem consistent with keeping the pics private.And one more thing ... we're told the would-be victim -- Blac Chyna -- would never go to the cops and file a police report.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendation #2 Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna are making new allegations of domestic violence against each other, and both claim the alleged incidents are captured on video.Chyna -- who's in court Monday morning for a domestic violence restraining order against Rob -- has already claimed Rob got physical with her.Sources connected with Chyna tell us she will add other claims, including one incident several months ago where she says Rob allegedly hit her and knocked her to the ground. She says she ran to her bedroom and he broke the door open. She supposedly has photos and videos of the incident.As for Rob, sources close to the situation say in December, the day Chyna moved out of the house she and Rob were sharing, she tried choking him with an iPhone cord and tried hitting him with a metal rod. The sources say Corey Gamble walked in and pulled Chyna off Rob. She then allegedly went through the house, smashing televisions, doors and other items, causing $35k in damage. The sources say Rob has surveillance video documenting the incident.We're also told Rob's lawyers have texts from the time Chyna moved out, in which she told a friend that Rob would never hit her. Our sources say they feel the messages help to vindicate Rob.\n",

      "Recommendation #3 Rob Kardashian's brutal rants against Blac Chyna showed her side piece the light -- and now Ferrari is kicking her to the curb too, and saving himself more than 100 grand in the process.Sources connected to the rapper, tell us Ferrari was hooked on Chyna ... so much so he dropped $135,648 on three pieces of jewelry for her:- $34,850 for a Rolex - $56,500 for a gold necklace- $32,250 for diamond earringsFerrari scooped up the booty back in June when he thought he and Chyna were the real deal -- she's even listed as \"spouse\" on the receipt. We're told they'd talked for a while about getting his and hers Rollies -- but after Rob accused BC of banging several dudes, Ferrari was done.We're told his manager, Keely the Boss, planned to deliver the gifts on July 5, but that's the day Rob unleashed his allegations. Ferrari immediately called off the delivery and returned everything on Friday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendation #4 Blac Chyna's beefing up her personal security and got her former side piece banned from her upcoming club appearance ... because his recent actions are scaring her.Sources close to Chyna tell TMZ ... Ferrari won't be allowed in at the Medusa Restaurant & Lounge in Atlanta Saturday night, where Blac is scheduled to host a party. We're told  Chyna's hired 4 extra bodyguards for the night in case the rapper -- who hails from ATL -- shows up.Chyna's camp claims Ferrari's been calling and texting her the past week, and demands for him to stop the harassment having been blown off. We're told Chyna believes he's released revenge porn despite a letter warning him not to, and she also fears for her safety because he's acting obsessive and delusional. His interview with TMZ particularly scared her.The owner of Medusa, Lil Henny, tells us he will honor Chyna's ban request and make sure Ferrari is not allowed on the premises while she's working the joint.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendation #5 Rob Kardashian is deeply remorseful for slut shaming Blac Chyna ... at least that's what he told his family.Sources close to the situation tell TMZ ... Rob's spoken with all of his sisters and his mom, telling them he has no excuse for posting nude pics of Chyna and her medical information on social media. He said he regrets he didn't deal with the Chyna drama privately and said it wouldn't happen again.One thing Rob did not apologize for ... he flatly denied he ever physically abused Chyna.Rob also acknowledged all of the Kardashian women warned him Chyna was \"bad news\" and he should stay away ... advice he ignored. He told them they were right.He also said he stayed with Chyna longer than he should have because he grew up in a 2-parent household and wanted the same for Dream.We're told Rob and family have stayed quiet through the ordeal in an effort to stop the back and forth in the best interest of his daughter.We're told the women accepted his apology and are hopeful he'll heed their advice.\n",
