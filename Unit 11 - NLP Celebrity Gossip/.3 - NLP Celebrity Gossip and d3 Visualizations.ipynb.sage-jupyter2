An eBay spokesperson tells us the company doesn't allow sales of items that \"attempt to profit from tragedy.\" We're told they contacted and educated the seller, and will take further action if it happens again.\n\nLinkin Park's Mike Shinoda is trying to get back to a normal life after his bandmate Chester Bennington's death nearly two weeks ago.Shinoda and his wife, Anna, held hands Wednesday as they left Beverly Glen Market in Los Angeles.

Of course, they canceled the tour after Chester's suicide.Shinoda, along with bandmate Joe Hahn, eulogized Chester at Saturday's private funeral in Palos Verdes.\n\nChester Bennington's death certificate confirms the details we knew ... that the 41-year-old singer committed suicide with a belt.According to the doc, obtained by TMZ, the Linkin Park singer died at 9:08 AM in his residence on July 20.

Bennington died in his home nearly 2 weeks ago.\n\nColdplay made it clear with a moving tribute during their concert ... Chester Bennington's death is still weighing heavily on the minds of his comrades in the music biz.Chris Martin and co. kicked off their North American tour Tuesday night in NJ, and near the show's end ...

A full stage, including a drum kit, was set up for musical tributes to be performed.Police provided tight security at the event. As TMZ first reported ... the family opted for a private funeral, instead of a massive open service. Instead, fans have organized numerous memorials around the globe for the frontman, who hanged himself just over a week ago.Fittingly, all funeral attendees had to have wrist bands and an access pass -- similar to most concert VIP passes.Chester was 41. #RIP\n\nChester Bennington ﻿will be celebrated far and wide by Linkin Park fans who want to pay their final respects ... and the band's completely on board.Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda tweeted a link telling fans about a monumental effort to pay tribute to Chester all over the world -- in L.A., NYC, Vancouver, Paris, Copenhagen, Japan and beyond.TMZ broke the story ...

In fact ... some will be held at venues where the band was supposed to play before canceling its tour.Still unclear if band members will attend any of the events.\n\nChester Bennington's wife, Talinda, says her family's life went from \"fairytale\" to \"sick Shakespearean tragedy\" since her husband's suicide a week ago.Talinda released a statement, saying ... \"How do I move on? How do I pick up my shattered soul? The only answer I know is to raise our babies with every ounce of love I have left. I want to let my community and the fans worldwide know that we feel your love. We feel your loss as well. My babies are so young to have lost their daddy.\"Chester, who has 3 kids with Talinda, hanged himself in the family's new Rancho Palos Verdes Estates home.Talinda says she lost her soulmate and her kids lost their hero.

We're told the family just hasn't figured out how to give fans their moment to honor Chester.As for Chester's final resting place -- we're told the family's not jumping at the offer to take the plot next to Chris Cornell at Hollywood Forever Cemetery because it's in such a public space.\n\nChester Bennington's death investigation has turned up no obvious signs of drug use ... TMZ has learned.Law enforcement sources tell us investigators found no illegal drugs or prescription drugs while searching the home following Chester's suicide. As we reported ... there was a partially drunk bottle of alcohol in the bedroom where he was found hanging.The Linkin Park frontman was open about his drug abuse issues -- acid, meth, crack and more. His bandmates were well aware of his demons, and he credited his bandmates for staging an intervention.It's unclear if Chester had any drugs in his system at the time of death. Toxicology results are pending.\n\nChester Bennington bought his new family home about 2 months before he hanged himself there ... adding another layer of mystery to his death.The Linkin Park frontman bought the Palos Verdes Estates house for $2.5 million back in June. The 5 bedroom, 4 bathroom house is in an affluent part of L.A. County famous for pristine neighborhoods and an excellent public school system.Everything about the 3,956 square foot pad says family home -- special nook perfect for game night, 3 outdoor decks, an expansive backyard with a spa and swimming pool.The purchase falls in line with what Chester's LP bandmates said -- that he'd spoken excitedly about future plans. Buying the perfect place for his family, but then taking his life there a month later just doesn't add up.The Benningtons closed on the house 8 days after Chris Cornell's suicide ... leading some close friends to believe Chester's suicide decision was sudden and fueled by his grief.\n\nChester Bennington's housekeeper cried and screamed in the background as a driver for the Linkin Park frontman made the 911 call to report his suicide.Cops just released the 911 call made by the driver, who was most likely there to pick up Chester for a scheduled photo shoot. He told the operator, \"I just got to the location and his housekeeper came out and said he killed himself ... he hung himself.\"As the driver relayed more details, the housekeeper was absolutely distraught in the background ... crying hysterically as she spoke to Chester's wife on another phone.TMZ broke the story ...

Chester's family was out of town, and Thursday morning the housekeeper found his body.\n\nChester Bennington's bandmates are remembering him for his musical talent ... and also the demons that ultimately led to his suicide.Linkin Park posted an open letter to Chester in which they thank the fans for the outpouring of love and support, and say of the singer ... \"You touched so many lives, maybe even more than you realized.\" It sounds like they didn't see any warning signs before Chester took his own life because they say, \"Talking with you about the years ahead together, your excitement was infectious.\"The band addressed their frontman's demons too -- \"You fearlessly put them on display, and in doing so, brought us together and taught us to be more human.\"https://t.co/CkwWKW25et pic.twitter.com/364B8vHRmf\n\nChester Bennington's suicide -- and also Chris Cornell's -- has Gavin Rossdale wondering about what he describes as a \"bad scene\" in music right now.He and his band Bush performed Thursday night in Hammond, Indiana ... and addressed the crowd about what had happened earlier that day -- Linkin Park's frontman killing himself. As TMZ first reported ... Chester took his life in an eerily similar way to his dear friend Chris Cornell.Gavin talked about the last time he'd seen Chester -- singing \"Hallelujah\" at Cornell's funeral.It was obvious, he was struggling to make sense of the deaths, saying it was \"impossible to know what\" Chester was going through. Still, he tried to inspire his fans ... before launching into \"Glycerine.\"\n\nLinkin Park's Chester Bennington might get an eternal resting spot right next to his dear friend, Chris Cornell.TMZ has learned the burial plot beside Cornell at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery is available ... and a source at the cemetery tells us they expect Chester's family to call about buying it.Chester was very close with the Soundgarden frontman ... he performed \"Hallelujah\" at his funeral, and had a difficult time coping with his death.We broke the story ...

A rep for the band tells us the guys are so devastated they can't think clearly enough to make a decision.The Xfinity Center in Mansfield is fielding hundreds of calls from ticketholders, who are being told to \"standby.\"Fans might not have to wait long ... we're told the decision will likely come today.Stay tuned ...\n\nChester Bennington may have mimicked the suicide of his close friend, Chris Cornell, because they died in virtually identical ways.Law enforcement sources tell us, the Linkin Park singer was found hanging from a door separating his bedroom from his closet. TMZ broke the story, Chris Cornell died hanging from a hotel door separating the bedroom from the bathroom.We're also told Chester was found with a belt around his neck.

While promoting the show, host Chris Harrison has said he'll be talking with both of them together ... insinuating he'd be mediating/refereeing.While fans would eat that up ... it ain't gonna happen. We're told DeMario came out for a solo sit-down with Harrison, but left before Corinne did her one-on-one. We're told neither were briefed on plans to be onstage at the same time.Our DeMario sources tell us he's no longer interested in seeing Corinne face-to-face to hash out the aftermath from their pool sex encounter -- mostly because he doesn't think she would be genuine. \n\n"},"1":{"name":"stdout","text":"Recommendation #1 Turns out controversial \"Bachelor In Paradise\" star DeMario Jackson may not be done with reality TV -- TMZ has learned producers are seriously considering him for a \"Dancing With the Stars\" slot.Sources close to production tell us the show reached out to DeMario's publicist weeks ago, which explains why he was already fully campaigning to be in the ballroom when we asked about it last week.We're told nothing's signed ... they're still negotiating, but hard to imagine a scenario where DeMario doesn't take this opportunity.DeMario didn't return to the 'BiP' set in Mexico following the oral sex controversy with Corinne Olympios that shut down production, but he will be on the reunion episode.\n\nRecommendation #2 \"Bachelor in Paradise\" has a new way of reeling in viewers ... tapping into the sex scandal that temporarily shipwrecked the show.Production sources tell TMZ, host Chris Harrison held a powwow with the cast on the first day back to film the show after the Warner Bros. probe concluded there was no sexual assault ... and the cameras were rolling as he took people back to the Corinne Olympios/DeMario Jackson sexual escapade in the pool.We're told Harrison dramatically recounted how a producer expressed concerns and it turned into a full blown scandal. After taking everyone through the investigation, he paused, then asked the cast if they were comfortable continuing, and gave them a chance to pack up and leave.To absolutely no one's surprise, everyone stayed, drank and even banged in the boom boom room.Lemonade ... it comes from lemons.\n\nRecommendation #3 DeMario Jackson is looking for answers, and thinks a 1-on-1 with Corinne Olympios could help him finally get some peace of mind ... but she's gotta make the first move.Sources close to the \"Bachelor in Paradise\" outcast tell TMZ ... he wants to chat with Corinne about her sexual assault claim. DeMario's telling friends he doesn't hold a grudge -- after being cleared by Warner Bros. -- especially since he's bound to see Corinne again with other 'Bachelor' alums.We're told DeMario was \"blindsided and confused\" when he heard she claimed to be a victim, because when they got sent home producers told him it was because a third party had a problem with their pool sexcapade -- not Corinne.DeMario assumed he and Corinne would move on and be friends since they got along so well the first day filming -- laughing, chatting and hooking up -- so he doesn't understand what changed.There's a catch -- we're also told DeMario's not going to reach out to Corinne. He feels the ball's in her court since she played the victim card ... but he'll drop everything to meet with her if she calls.\n\nRecommendation #4 Corinne Olympios' boyfriend knew exactly what he was signing up for when she decided to go on \"Bachelor in Paradise\" ... with one HUGE caveat.Sources close to the couple tell TMZ ... Corinne and her BF, Jordan Gielchinsky, agreed she would NOT hook up with other cast members, and was only going to do the show to get pub for her new clothing line. Her plan was to be on for a couple episodes, and then bow out.Of course, that plan went to crap on the first day of taping when DeMario Jackson and Corinne ended up \"rubbing, touching and fingering\" in the pool. We broke the story ... Warner Bros. shut down production, launched an investigation and sent the cast home.We're told Jordan was initially upset when he heard what went down, but once he got the full context of the event -- meaning the heavy drinking -- he backed Corinne. He agrees she was way too drunk to give consent, and strongly believes producers and medical staffers should have intervened.The couple's been inseparable in L.A. since she returned from Mexico.\n\nRecommendation #5 Production for 'Bachelor in Paradise' has been suspended after allegations of misconduct were reported ... which puts a halt to filming for the upcoming season indefinitely.Warner Bros. execs for the show said Sunday that they had been alerted to some sort of misconduct on the set of 'BiP', which is currently shooting in Mexico.As a result of the allegations -- which at this point have not been made public -- WB has put a temporary halt to the show and is now investigating. They've said they will also take appropriate action upon completing the investigation.This season of 'BiP' is highly anticipated, especially after Nick Viall's recent stint on 'The Bachelor.' Some of his axed ladies like Raven Gates, Corinne Olympios and Taylor Nolan were cast, as was Amanda Stanton from Ben Higgins' season. Some of the guys cast were Derek Peth, Nick Benvenutti, Ben Zorn and DeMario Jackson.\n\nArticle numbers similar to article 100: [253, 756, 1080, 1271, 1426]\n"}},"pos":46,"start":1576625888225,"state":"done","type":"cell"}

She pitched a fit when a guy next door started pitching a roof at 9 AM. We're told Chyna confronted the homeowner, saying it was too damn early to start construction. She said the noise woke up little Dream, and that pissed her off.The neighbor claims Chyna went so ballistic she got scared and called the cops.We're told cops showed up and gave Chyna a free lesson about the law. In L.A., construction can fire up at 7 AM, so the roofer was well within his rights.Chyna calmed down, and cops beat it. \n\nRecommendation #1 Rob Kardashian's revenge against Blac Chyna -- posting pics of her vagina and breasts -- would seem to violate the revenge porn law ... but that doesn't seem to be the case.As we reported, Rob believed Chyna was cheating on him and he went on the warpath, not only posting the pics but after they were removed ... he reposted them.In California there's a 2013 law which states ... \"A person who intentionally distributes the image of the intimate body part of another ... knowing they'll cause emotional distress\" is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by up to 6 months in jail.You would think it's a textbook case of revenge porn, but there's a rub. Chyna \"liked\" the pics on Instagram, so it's hard to argue she suffered emotional distress.What's more ... the law says in order to be convicted there must have been an understanding the images would remain private. \"Liking\" the pics does not seem consistent with keeping the pics private.And one more thing ... we're told the would-be victim -- Blac Chyna -- would never go to the cops and file a police report.\n\nRecommendation #2 Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna are making new allegations of domestic violence against each other, and both claim the alleged incidents are captured on video.Chyna -- who's in court Monday morning for a domestic violence restraining order against Rob -- has already claimed Rob got physical with her.Sources connected with Chyna tell us she will add other claims, including one incident several months ago where she says Rob allegedly hit her and knocked her to the ground. She says she ran to her bedroom and he broke the door open. She supposedly has photos and videos of the incident.As for Rob, sources close to the situation say in December, the day Chyna moved out of the house she and Rob were sharing, she tried choking him with an iPhone cord and tried hitting him with a metal rod. The sources say Corey Gamble walked in and pulled Chyna off Rob. She then allegedly went through the house, smashing televisions, doors and other items, causing $35k in damage. The sources say Rob has surveillance video documenting the incident.We're also told Rob's lawyers have texts from the time Chyna moved out, in which she told a friend that Rob would never hit her. Our sources say they feel the messages help to vindicate Rob.\n\nRecommendation #3 Rob Kardashian's brutal rants against Blac Chyna showed her side piece the light -- and now Ferrari is kicking her to the curb too, and saving himself more than 100 grand in the process.Sources connected to the rapper, tell us Ferrari was hooked on Chyna ... so much so he dropped $135,648 on three pieces of jewelry for her:- $34,850 for a Rolex - $56,500 for a gold necklace- $32,250 for diamond earringsFerrari scooped up the booty back in June when he thought he and Chyna were the real deal -- she's even listed as \"spouse\" on the receipt. We're told they'd talked for a while about getting his and hers Rollies -- but after Rob accused BC of banging several dudes, Ferrari was done.We're told his manager, Keely the Boss, planned to deliver the gifts on July 5, but that's the day Rob unleashed his allegations. Ferrari immediately called off the delivery and returned everything on Friday.\n\nRecommendation #4 Blac Chyna's beefing up her personal security and got her former side piece banned from her upcoming club appearance ... because his recent actions are scaring her.Sources close to Chyna tell TMZ ... Ferrari won't be allowed in at the Medusa Restaurant & Lounge in Atlanta Saturday night, where Blac is scheduled to host a party. We're told  Chyna's hired 4 extra bodyguards for the night in case the rapper -- who hails from ATL -- shows up.Chyna's camp claims Ferrari's been calling and texting her the past week, and demands for him to stop the harassment having been blown off. We're told Chyna believes he's released revenge porn despite a letter warning him not to, and she also fears for her safety because he's acting obsessive and delusional. His interview with TMZ particularly scared her.The owner of Medusa, Lil Henny, tells us he will honor Chyna's ban request and make sure Ferrari is not allowed on the premises while she's working the joint.\n\nRecommendation #5 Rob Kardashian is deeply remorseful for slut shaming Blac Chyna ... at least that's what he told his family.Sources close to the situation tell TMZ ... Rob's spoken with all of his sisters and his mom, telling them he has no excuse for posting nude pics of Chyna and her medical information on social media. He said he regrets he didn't deal with the Chyna drama privately and said it wouldn't happen again.One thing Rob did not apologize for ... he flatly denied he ever physically abused Chyna.Rob also acknowledged all of the Kardashian women warned him Chyna was \"bad news\" and he should stay away ... advice he ignored. He told them they were right.He also said he stayed with Chyna longer than he should have because he grew up in a 2-parent household and wanted the same for Dream.We're told Rob and family have stayed quiet through the ordeal in an effort to stop the back and forth in the best interest of his daughter.We're told the women accepted his apology and are hopeful he'll heed their advice.\n\nArticle numbers similar to article 22: [859, 751, 788, 611, 689]\n"}},"pos":48,"start":1576625889865,"state":"done","type":"cell"}
